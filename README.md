Lawful Path -- Maxims of Law random generator

With the consent of the owner of the [original website]([url](https://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/bouvier/maxims.shtml#A)https://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/bouvier/maxims.shtml#A) this is what i was able to make.

I've always wanted to create something related to law. Any individual in any community will always benefit in knowing and applying well known principles and natural law.
Challenging myself in EJS, NodeJS, CSS and Javascript scripting I've created 1.0 of the app which should run a couple of 100's Maxims in a 20 second interval or upon clicking the button. 

# future updates
want to make page prettier, maybe try and make a section specifically for "Word Study"
add more maxims and see if I could possibly seperate them like: 

latin : latin quote
english: english quote
source: srcjdnajdsa or blank if nothing

port code as an app to android/ios that has opt in notifications.
